# 16-bit Comparator using GPIO and Spartan 6

## Project Overview
This project implements a 16-bit comparator on a Spartan 6 FPGA, using GPIO pins for input and output. The comparator checks two 16-bit binary numbers and outputs whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

## Features
- **16-bit comparison**: Compares two 16-bit binary numbers.
- **Three output signals**: Indicates whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
- **GPIO interface**: Uses GPIO pins for input and output signals.
- **Efficient implementation**: Designed for low power consumption and high performance on Spartan 6 FPGA.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - Spartan 6 FPGA
  - GPIO pins for input/output
  - Development board (e.g., Digilent Nexys 3 or similar)
- **Software**:
  - Xilinx ISE/Vivado for synthesis and implementation
  - Verilog for hardware description language
